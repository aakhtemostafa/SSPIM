Here, we present Structured SPIM (SSPIM), which provides an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for beam shaping that can generate digital patterns for a wide range of illumination beams. SSPIM represents a toolbox to produce static, spherical Gaussian, Bessel and Airy beams by simple control of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition, it is able to produce patterns for incoherent and coherent (lattice beam) array beam formation and tiling for all types of beams supported.SSPIM is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) of MATLAB and is also able to work standalone. Output patterns of the SSPIM can be used with any type of SLM, such as gray scale or binary SLMs.
