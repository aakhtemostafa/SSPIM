Here, we present Structured SPIM (SSPIM), which provides an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for beam shaping that can generate digital patterns for a wide range of illumination beams.

# 1. Graphical user interface

SSPIM represents a toolbox to produce static, spherical Gaussian, Bessel and Airy beams by simple control of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition, it is able to produce patterns for incoherent and coherent (lattice beam) array beam formation and tiling for all types of beams supported.SSPIM is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) of MATLAB and is also able to work standalone. Output patterns of the SSPIM can be used with any type of SLM, such as gray scale or binary SLMs.

# 2. Capabilitis of SPPIM

The SSPIM toolbox has capabilities to generate different type of SLM patterns for a wide range optical beams using differnt methods.

âˆ™ Static Gaussian beam 

âˆ™ 1D Airy beam

âˆ™ 2D Airy beam

âˆ™ Bessel beam

âˆ™ Incoherent Gaussian array beams

âˆ™ Incoherent Bessel array beams

âˆ™ Incoherent Airy array beams

âˆ™ Square lattice beam

âˆ™ Hexagonal lattice beam

âˆ™ Tiling method for all type of the beams.

*SLM pattern generating for lattice beam is depended to the position of the SLM in the optical setup than to illumination objective lens.

âˆ™ Damman gating 

âˆ™ Optimal grating

âˆ™ Amplitude mask (ellipse, annular, Gaussian, rectangular )

âˆ™ Far field intensity prediction as a feedback.

âˆ™ Gray value SLM pattern

âˆ™ Binary value SLM Pattern
