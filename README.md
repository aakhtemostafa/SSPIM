Here, we present Structured SPIM (SSPIM), which provides an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for beam shaping that can generate digital patterns for a wide range of illumination beams. SSPIM represents a toolbox to produce static, spherical Gaussian, Bessel and Airy beams by simple control of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition, it is able to produce patterns for incoherent and coherent (lattice beam) array beam formation and tiling for all types of beams supported.SSPIM is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) of MATLAB and is also able to work standalone. Output patterns of the SSPIM can be used with any type of SLM, such as gray scale or binary SLMs.

# Installation
# Requirements 
# Gallary
# Features of SPPIM

● Stoandalone graphical user interface to generating SLM pattern for structured beam.

● Static Gaussian beam

● 1D Airy beam

● 2D Airy beam

● Bessel beam

● Damman gating 

● Optimal grating

● Incoherent Gaussian beams

● Incoherent Bessel beams

* Generating SLM pattern for lattice beam is depended to the position of the SLM in the optical setup than to illumination objective lens. 

● Amplitude mask (ellipse, annular, Gaussian, rectangular )

● Tiling method for all type of the beams.

● Far field intensity prediction as a feedback.

● Gray value SLM pattern

● Binary value SLM Pattern
